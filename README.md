## Description of the Problem:

<b><u>Abstract Definition:</b></u>

Consider 'N' points on a 2D plane which need to be visited at least once by 'M' bots.
Provide a path for all of the 'M' bots such that the total distance travelled by the bots is minimum.

<b><u>Consider the following </b></u>

<b> Target Points </b>
P1, a set of ‘N’ points
P1 = { p1, p2, p3, … pN }

<b> Bots </b>
P2, a set of 'M' points 
P2  = { b1, b2, b3, ... bM }

<b> <u> M<<N </b> </u>

Return a matrix Y which gives the sequence of points needed by each of the bots to cover all the points minimizzing the total distace travelled.

<b> Y[i,j] = ith point in the path of bot j.

# Attempt to Solution
This project aims to design and test a customized model of Markov Decision Process and attempt to solve it using Cooperative Q-Learning.

<b> Reasons for Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning to be the best approach for solution </b>

<b> <u> M<<N </b> </u>

1.  Consider the use case where M=50 (50 bots) and N=1000 (1000 Target Points)
2. The total number of possible paths is in order of 10^90 which is much greater than the generic use cases of 20 possible paths
3.  The environment is unexplored, meaning that location of all the 1000 points is unknown, The bots need to explore and simultaneously learn to move efficiently in the environment. Absence of exact knowledge of environment rules out the validity of deterministic algorithms.

In this project, the notion of multi-agent envronment is implemented using a novel method which we call <b> ConnectedQ </b>
